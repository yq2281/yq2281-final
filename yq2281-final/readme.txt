My name is Yi Qu. My UNI is yq2281. This is the final project.

I have an app.py file which module imports Flask, creates static routes to three pages, and starts the server. I have two folders. The templates folder contains my HTML templates for the three pages I made. The static folder contains the two images I have put into my pages.

I misinterpreted the homework instructions and accidently wrote the majority of my code before realizing I needed to initialize a Git Repository. However, I do anticipate some tweaks in formatting here and there, and will make git commits as I re-visit my code.
